# Face Feature Extraction using ArcFace Model

This repository provides an implementation of face feature extraction using the **ArcFace** model for facial recognition tasks. The feature extraction is done through a function provided in the `feature_extraction.py` file, which uses the `ArcFace` model located inside the `networks` folder.


## Installation
